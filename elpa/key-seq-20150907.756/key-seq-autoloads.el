Define a key sequence of the two keys in KEYS starting a COMMAND.

KEYS can be a string or a vector of two elements. Currently only elements
that corresponds to ascii codes in the range 32 to 126 can be used.

COMMAND can be an interactive function, a string, or nil.
If COMMAND is nil, the key-chord is removed.

Note that KEYS defined locally in the current buffer will have precedence.
