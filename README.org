#+TITLE: .emacs.d
This is my emacs configuration folder.
* Reason of Using Emacs
It support *Org Mode*! I've been struggling with Microsoft ToDo, iOS reminder, etc.
Those are slow at syncing and have no cross-platform support (between win, ios, linux).
So I choose Org Mode, which provides high levels of customization.
* What Did I Configured
Evil... and other keymapping stuffs.
